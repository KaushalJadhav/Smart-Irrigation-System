<br>This project uses Arduino UNO along with soil moisture sensor (HW103) , a relay and water pump. Soil moisture sensor is dipped in the soil which gives output voltage to the Arduino UNO I/O pin. This is proportional to the amount of moisture in the soil. Arduino UNO compares the reading with the threshold value set by user and controls ON/OFF of the water pump through relay. In the absense of farmer/gardner this system can be used to control watering of the plants depending on amount of soil moisture.It saves water and human efforts.
